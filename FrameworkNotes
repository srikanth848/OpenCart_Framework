Framework --> organizing automation project files/folders in structured manner

Main Objectives are
1. Re-usability
	- utilities
	- avoiding duplication
2. Maintainability
	- should allow modification of test cases
3. Readability
	- should be understandable by everyone (even for beginners)	


Types of Frameworks
-------------------
1. Built-in (third party libraries which can be installed and used)
   Ex: TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, Robot,....

2. Customized (user defined)
   Ex: Data Driven, Keyword Driven, Hybrid Driven, Modular...


Phases/Stages involved for framework development
------------------------------------------------
1. Analyzing AUT (Application Under Test)
	- Number of pages to be automated --> POM classes will be decided
	- What are all elements to be automated, what type of elements they are and how can be automated
	- What to be automated and What cannot be automated
	
2. Choose test cases for automation (test cases are chosen based on the priority)
	- Sanity test cases (P1) --> if these test cases are failed, we cannot proceed further
	- Data Driven test cases/re-tests (P2) --> repeating tests with different data
	- Regression test cases (P3) --> tests chosen from the impacted areas due to defect/change
	- Any other test cases that can be automated (P4)
	  --> these tests can be later regression tests for any other defects
	  --> these will be automated based on the time-lines

** Automation starts only when the build/application becomes stable
	
** Can we achieve 100% automation ??
	- Say there are 100 test cases --> 90 can be automated and 10 cannot be automated
      If we are able to automate all 90 test cases ==> 100% automation
    - If expectation is to automate entire application, then 100% automation is not possible
   
3. Design & Development of framework
	- Design is blueprint/creation of folder structure of the framework
	  --> page object classes, utility files, reports, test data files, tests,...... within framework where we can have all these will be decided during design
	
	- Development is adding the stuff into framework
	  --> adding page object classes, utilities, test cases, test data files,..... at the initial stage and as the project progresses development activities will be carried out
   
4. Execution (test suite chosen specific to the requirement)
	- Execution can be local and remote
	  --> within the local system using IDE
	  --> some other environment/machine using Selenium GRID, Jenkin (pulling the code from remote repository --> Git)

5. Maintenance (mostly happens as the project progresses)
	- As multiple resources are involved in the development, everyone will have their own local repository
	- Once done with the development, the code/files will be pushed to remote repository
	- From remote repository, code will be pulled and run in remote environment (Ex: Devops Environment --> Jenkins)


Domain --> Specific area
Ex: Banking, HealthCare, E-Commerce....


1. Front-End Operation (Customers/Users)
	- Register an account
	- Login
	- Search for the products
	- Order products
	- Payment process
	- Log Out
	......
	
2. Back-End Operations (Admins/Backend Team)
	- Customers/Accounts
	- Products
	- Orders
	- Payments
	.......

Steps
-----
1. Create Maven Project
2. Add required dependencies in pom.xml
	- Selenium, Apache POI, TestNG, Extent Reports, Log4j, Commons
3. Create folder structure
	- src/test/java
		- pageObjects --> stores all web elements and required actions
		- testBase    --> reusable methods
		- testCases   --> test cases
		- utilities   --> excel utility, extent report utility, data providers
	- src/test/resources
		- properties  --> configuration properties
	- logs            --> log files
	- reports         --> extent reports
	- screenshots     --> failure screenshots
	- testData        --> test data files
4. Start with the development
	- adding Page Object classes, test cases classes, excel utility class, extent report class
5. Start executing the test cases using .xml files
	- create master.xml, grouping.xml, cross-browserTesting.xml....
6. Setting up Grid


Logs
-----
Log files are used for logging/recording all the events in the form of text
	- name of the log file should always be log4j2.xml
	- every action performed on the application can be logged through the test case
	- pass/failure of tests are also recorded in log file
	
** Log Levels --> All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off

Appenders --> where to generate logs (Console/File)
Loggers   --> what level of logs should be generated

** Logger has to be imported from the correct package (log4j)
** Declare and initiate Logger in BaseClass
	- Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(this.getClass); --> this will get the class name during runtime based on the logging request made


config.properties file
----------------------
properties file is used for maintaining common data/variables


Extent Report
-------------
This is one time configuration to the project and is invoked using Listeners tag


** Failed tests are captured in "testng-failed.xml" --> located under test-output folder
	-- this file is helpful in running the failed tests only
	-- file will refresh only when the next failure occurs

	
Selenium Grid
-------------
Mainly consists of Hub and Nodes
	- Hub is where the Grid is setup and controls the execution
	- Nodes are different physical/virtual machines that are connected to Hub
	
Standalone setup (Single Machine) --> same machine acts as Hub and Node
	- download the selenium server jar
	- run the command "java -jar selenium-server-4.20.0.jar standalone"
	- post successful setup, it will provide the URL - http://192.168.0.114:4444/ui/ ==> http://localhost:4444/ui/

Distributed setup (Mutliple Machines) --> multiple remote nodes are connected to single Hub
						   				  based on OS & Browser, tests will be executed on a particular node
	- download the selenium server jar in hub and nodes
	- run the command "java -jar selenium-server-4.20.0.jar hub" ==> on Hub machine
	- run the command "java -jar selenium-server-4.20.0.jar node --hub http://<Hub IP>:4444" ==> on Node machines
	- post successful setup, it will provide the URL - http://192.168.0.114:4444/ui/ ==> http://localhost:4444/ui/

Docker --> Containerization tool
	- offers different images (specific OS)
	- create containers by downloading the images
	- these containers will act as nodes

Docker Setup
------------
1. Download Docker executable file (Docker Desktop Installer) and restart the system
2. Sign up with personal email
3. Post successful installation, run the below commands in command prompt to ensure docker service is running
	- docker version 			==> shows client and server details
	- docker-compose version
	
Common Commands:
	- docker -v 					==> shows the docker version
	- docker info 					==> shows the docker system-wide information
	- docker --help 				==> shows the list of docker commands
	- docker login					==> for logging into docker
	
Image related Commands:
	- docker images 				==> shows the available images information
	- docker pull <image name>  	==> downloads the image
	- docker rmi <image name/ID>	==> deletes the image
	
Container Commands:
	- docker ps 					==> shows the containers that are currently running
	- docker run <image name> 		==> creates the container with image (if image is not available, it will download and create container)
	- docker run -it <image name>	==> starts running the container
	- docker stop <container ID>	==> stops the container
	- docker start <container ID> 	==> starts the stopped container only
	- docker rm <container ID>		==> deletes the container
	
System Commands:
	- docker stats 					==> provides the system statistics for running cintainer
	- docker system 				==> provides the images, containers information
	- docker system prune -f		==> forcefully deletes all the stopped containers

	
Selenium Grid setup with Docker
--------------------------------
1. Download the required images (hub, nodes)
	- docker pull selenium/hub
	- docker pull selenium/node-chrome
	- docker pull selenium/node-edge
2. Create a network where hub and nodes are connected
	- docker network create <network name>
3. Create and run the containers
	- docker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --net <network name> --name selenium-hub selenium/hub
	- docker run -d --net <network name> -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-chrome
	- docker run -d --net <network name> -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-edge
4. we can see the Selenium Grid setup on http://localhost:4444/ui/
5. we are good to run the scripts/tests on Grid
6. create docker-compose.yaml file and run the below command to setup grid
	- docker-compose up
7. Use below command for removing containers and grid setup
	- docker-compose down
	

Execution
---------
testng.xml is used for running the tests internally or within the eclipse
pom.xml is used for running the tests outside of the eclipse

dependencies --> JARs/libraries on which project directly relies on for its functionality
plug-ins 	 --> used for compiling and running the project
1. Maven Compiler plug-in 
2. Maven Surefire plug-in

** configure testng.xml file suites under surefire plugin
** Run pom.xml as maven test --> this will internally execute testng.xml

In order to run tests with CI tools, we would need Maven installed on our machine
Download tar file and add Maven configuration path in Environment Variables
Run the below command to ensure Maven successfully installed
	- mvn -version
** Run the below command for running pom.xml through command prompt
	- mvn test

** Create run.bat (batch) file with the below contents and double click (running the batch file) 
	- cd <project path>
	- mvn test
	

Maven Goals --> specific tasks that contribute to the building and management of a project
	1. Compile	==> compiling code
	2. Deploy	==> deployment of code
	3. Test		==> Running tests 
	4. Package	==> Packaging artifacts
	5. Install	==> Installing dependencies
	
DevOps Team is responsible for
	1. Build Creation		==> code developed by developers is pulled and build is created using Maven
	2. Run Automation		==> automation scripts (Sanity) developed by QA are pulled and run using Jenkins against the created build
	3. Build Certification	==> finally build is certified and available for further testing in QA environment


GIT & GitHUB workflow
---------------------
1. Download and Install Git
2. Create an account in GitHUB
3. Create a local repository inside the project folder using the below command
	- git init
4. Configure username and email for local repository using the below commands
	- git config --global user.name "username" (Srikanth Pilli)
	- git config --global user.email "email" (srikanthpilli780@gmail.com)
5. Status of the files can be known using the below command
	- git status
	** untracked files ==> files available in workspace
	** tracked files   ==> files available in staging/indexing area
	** committed files ==> files available in local git repository
	** remote files    ==> files available in GitHUB repository
6. Files/Folders can be added to staging/index area using the below command
	- git add -A		==> All files and folders will be added
	- git add file		==> only particular file will be addedd
	- git add folder	==> only particular folder will be added
	- git add *.java	==> files with that particular extension will be added
7. Files can be committed to Local Git repository using the below command
	- git commit -m "message"
8. Create a new remote repository in GitHUB and link/connect both local & remote repositories using the below command
	- git remote add origin "repository URL" (https://github.com/srikanth848/OpenCart_Framework.git)
9. Push the files to remote repository using the below command
	- git push origin master
** if this is done for the first a log-in pop-up would come --> login

** Pushing files to remote repository will be everyday task, as new test cases or any other files will be developed and added to project
** Add to Staging, commit to local repository and push to remote repository

10. Pull the files from remote repository to local repository/Staging/workspace using the below command
	- git pull "repository URL"
** Only those files will be pulled which are not available/modified

11. Project/Repository can be cloned into local repository using the below command
	- git clone "cloning repository URL"
** Clones the entire project


Jenkins
-------
CI (Continuous Integration) Tool owned by DevOps team

Setting Up Jenkins
------------------
** Before setting up Jenkins, we should have JDK17/JDK21 installed and configured in System path

Download Jenkins .war file or Windows Installer
1. If .war is used then run the below command in command prompt and note the initial password
	- java -jar jenkins.war
2. If Windows Installer is used then select Run Service as LocalSystem in Service Logon Credentials screen and note the initial password from jenkins.err file
	
Once Installation is done, Jenkins will start running on port 8080 => http://localhost:8080

** Create First Admin user ==> Admin, admin

Check for the required plugins under Installed Plugins if not found install them from Available Plugins ==> Manage Jenkins -> Plugins -> Installed Plugins
	- Maven Integration Plugin, Git Plugin, GitHub Plugin

Configure the required tools => Manage Jenkins -> Tools
	- add JDK path, add Git executable file path, add Maven path

We are good to run the automation scripts from Jenkins

Running project that is available in remote repository:
1. Create a new Item
2. Provide a name for the Item and select Maven Project
3. Select Git as Source Code Management tool and provide the remote repository path
4. Provide Maven Goal as test and Root POM as pom.xml under Build
5. Click on Apply and Save ==> this will take you to the project specific dashboard
6. Click on Build and this will pull the project from remote repository, downloads the required resources and runs the tests
7. In main dashboard, we can see the Item entries created

Running project that is available in local workspace:
1. using pom.xml:
** Select None as Source Code Management tool
** Provide pom.xml file path

2. using batch file
** Select Freestyle Project instead of Maven Project
** Select Executable Windows Batch Command and provide the .bat file path under build steps
	- as this runs through command prompt mention "cd filePath"

** Jenkins run the tests on headless mode by default

As Jenkins owned by DevOps team, this tool won't be on our local machine and configuring pom.xml/.bat file paths are not recommended as these files/project won't be present in their environment/machine.
